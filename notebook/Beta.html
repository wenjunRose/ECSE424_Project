                <h3>1. Add Bottom to deactivate and activate the  alert device:</h3>
                <p>
                    We add a button on the alert device to deactivate the alert device when it is buzzing. We consider
                    the use case that users would get into a situation that a car will always be behind them and it will
                    cause the system to detect a car is behind and cause the alert device to always buzz. Thus, we add a
                    button to allow the user to freely deactivate the alert device and activate it.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>2. Arduino communicate via bluetooth </h3>
                <p>
                    In the alpha system we use jumper wire to establish communication between the two arduinos due to th
                    e fact that we did not have any bluetooth component on our hand during the implementation. After the
                    alpha system, we successfully integrate the bluetooth component inside our system and achieve the co
                    mmunication between the two arduinos and it brings great benefit to the encapsulation.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>3. Sensor detect range</h3>
                <p>
                    After the continuation of development and searching, we came to an agreement to set the ultrasonic s
                    ensor detect range to be 1.5 m. Since according to the current law, it is obligatory for the driver
                    to maintain a 1.5m distance between the bike, so we would definitely want to warn the user when a ca
                    r is approaching the user at this range and give them enough time to react.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>4. Encapsulation box</h3>
                <p>In the alpha system we use the cardboard to build the box for encapsulation of the system. It has com
                    e to our mind that using cardboard to build the box is unstable and easy to break. Thus, we decide t
                    o switch to using stone clay to build the box for the sensor and wood box for the alert device. It is
                    more stable and has more endurability and could allow our system to be performed in some more extreme
                    conditions.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <h3>5. Alert stops after one second if we have a car always behind the bike</h3>
                <p>We include a new feature inside our system that when we inside a situation that a car always behind t
                    he bike and it is also inside the detect range of our system such when a bike is waiting in front of
                    the traffic light and a car is behind it, it will cause our alpha system to keep buzzing and blinking
                    . We updated the system that it will only alert the user for one second and then it will stop. If th
                    e car is out of the detect range and enters again, the system will alert the user again.
